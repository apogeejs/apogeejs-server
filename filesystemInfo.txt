Linus File System Convention:

The /opt directory is a good location for the program distribution files. The /srv directory is used for the programs run-time data. (Please see the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard.) Unlike the /etc directory where the standard indicates that the /opt/<pkg> configuration files should be placed in /etc/opt/<pkg>, there is no standardization that /srv/opt/<pkg> should be a parallel structure (although it's probably not a bad idea).

In summary:

/opt/webserver/     (your node.js application)
    server.js
    package.json
    node_modules/
    ...

/etc/opt/webserver/
    config.json     (configuration file for your web server)

/srv/opt/webserver/ (opt subdirectory suggested, but not required)
    index.html
    images/
    css/
    ...

/var/opt/webserver
    error.log
    request.log
Please keep in mind that this is the general case, and is not unique to express applicaitons.

sudo chown -R bethany /DATA/SHARE
 

Let’s break this down.

sudo – admin rights must be used since we are dealing with a folder that belongs to another user

chown – the command for changing ownership

-R – the recursive switch to make sure all child objects get the same ownership changes

bethany – the new owner of the folder

/DATA/SHARE – the directory to be modified
